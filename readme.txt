Project description:
A normal pinball game with a twist-instead of using the keyboard for the flipper inputs, my game would rely on object detection through a live video feed to control the flippers.

How to run the game:
In order to run the game, you’d have to run the ‘main.py’ file through terminal or allow your VSCode to access your camera.
(On a mac, I found that this was a useful guide to configure your VSCode : https://rajathithanrajasekar.medium.com/opencv-series-2-configure-vscode-for-opencv-development-in-macos-4a2a06e144fa )
Once you run the file, simply press the spacebar to start playing the game.

Libraries needed:
You would need to install OpenCV (cv2) and NumPy in order to run the game.

Shortcut Commands:
All the possible keyboard inputs are listed in the sidebar in the game.
